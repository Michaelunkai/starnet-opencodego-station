/* STARNET — leftrail.js : the CREW rail's own layout. Four things, in this order:
   (1) the ROSTER WINDOW — how many crew rows the rail shows whole before it scrolls;
   (2) the ROSTER SEAM — the horizontal handle between the WORKING/IDLE strip and SESSIONS, which
       lets the Commander choose that row count by dragging (up = a shorter roster, a taller
       SESSIONS; down = the reverse);
   (3) hide/show — ◂ in the rail header hides the whole left column (the stage absorbs the space
       via the body.crew-rail-off grid overrides in app.css); a slim ▸ CREW drawer tab on the
       stage's left edge brings it back;
   (4) WIDTH — the seam on the stage's left edge writes --crew-w, the same way chatresize.js
       writes --chat-w.
   All of them persist per machine; both seams also reset on double-click. (1) re-measures on any
   of the others moving — its ResizeObserver watches #left, which a width drag resizes too. */

  /* ================= ROSTER WINDOW (2026-08-07) =================
     The roster used to be capped at a flat max-height:40% of the column, and a percentage is never
     a whole number of rows — so the cap landed MID-ROW and sliced the last agent in half. Measured
     on a 6-agent station that is 10px of a row at 1440x900, 18px at 780, 25px at 660: enough to
     read as BROKEN rather than as scrollable, which is exactly how it was reported.

     So the window is measured instead, and it always ends flush under a row:
       · it wants ROWS_MIN agents visible whole — the floor the rail promises;
       · past that it keeps the old 40% space split (RAIL SPACE SPLIT, 2026-07-27: the roster is
         content-sized and #ws-wrap takes the column's slack), so a tall rail still shows MORE
         than the floor rather than parking dead black under a short roster;
       · and it never takes so much that SESSIONS drops below WS_FLOOR.
     Whatever that budget works out to, the cap is then rounded DOWN to a whole row.

     …unless the Commander has dragged the ROSTER SEAM (below), in which case their row count
     replaces the automatic budget outright — the WS_FLOOR clamp and the whole-row rounding still
     apply, because those are what keep the result honest rather than what keeps it automatic.

     Rows are not a fixed height — a WORKING row grows the in-flight bar, a duplicate name grows an
     id chip — so the cap is summed from real row geometry every time, never from a constant. */
  /* EIGHT, not four (2026-10-01). The station's standard crew is eight, and the old floor of 4
     combined with SHARE to cap the roster at ~4 rows on a normal column — so a screenshot showed
     NOVA/FOREMAN/RESEARCHER/ENGINEER and read as "the crew is missing" even though #crew-sum said
     7 WORKING. The floor is the number of whole agents the rail PROMISES: making it the full
     standard crew is what guarantees all eight are visible at once. The SESSIONS floor (spare,
     below) still wins when the column is genuinely too short, and the overflow tell then says so. */
  const ROWS_MIN = 8;     // agents the rail shows whole even when the column is tight
  const SHARE = 0.4;      // …and past that, the roster's historic share of the column
  const WS_FLOOR = 132;   // px SESSIONS keeps below no matter how deep the crew: head + search + ~2 rows

  /* THE decision, kept separate from the measuring so it is testable without a layout engine.
     `cuts` is the max-height that would end the window flush under each row in turn (so it is
     already monotonically increasing and already carries the list's own padding). Returns the
     largest of those that the budget allows — never a value BETWEEN two cuts, which is the whole
     point — and never fewer than one row, however tight the column gets.
     `o.rows` is the Commander's dragged row count: it names the budget instead of the automatic
     ROWS_MIN/SHARE pair, and everything after it (the SESSIONS floor, the whole-row rounding, the
     one-row floor) still applies unchanged. ZERO is one of its legal values — the roster dragged
     shut, SESSIONS owning the column — and is NOT the same as null, which means "measure it". */

     Andrew: "users should have the option to raise the sessions way higher if they want more space

     Commander running four agents and forty sessions wants the split the other way round, and
     until now the only lever was hiding the rail entirely.

     So the split gets a handle, in the same vocabulary as the two column seams (pointer capture,
     rAF-coalesced writes, per-machine persistence, double-click resets to the measured default) —
     with one thing they don't have: it SNAPS. The roster window's whole law is that a cap landing
     between two rows reads as broken, so a dragged cap lands on a row cut too. The drag moves in
     notches by design; dragging past the last row simply stops, and one whole row is the floor. */
